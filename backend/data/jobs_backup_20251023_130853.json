Headquartered in Sacramento, California, we have since grown out of our previous 3 offices and many of our close to 150 employees are spread all across the United States. Those 150 employees support close to 300,000 users across 5,000 offices nationwide and now in Canada as well. Included in that is 8 out of the 15 largest Real Estate Brokerages in the nation.But, despite being happy with what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of work left to be done. All of the growth and success that has happened is a result of us obsessing over building cutting edge software that makes the Real Estate world a better place. We know this only happens by hiring people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just come up with out of the box ideas but hiring people who actually see those ideas through and bring them to life. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fortunate enough to hire plenty of people who possess that quality and realize it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equally important to hire people who can pair that skill with empathy, collaboration, and a keen sense of urgency. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to join a company where you can have real impact and surround yourself with an incredible team of people then look no further.
