We've been featured in Forbes, Huffington Post, Thrive Global, and Inc.We expand healthcare access in the United States by helping Nurse Practitioner Students graduate on time. We support nurse practitioners by providing a fast, secure, easy-to-use website where Preceptors get paid for their energy, time, and hard-won expertise. What Does NPHub Do?We help Nurse Practitioner students graduate from their Masters and Doctorate programs on time. Currently NP students are required to find their own clinical placements (i.e. internships) and struggle to do so. As a result, thousands of students delay graduation every year because they cannot find these placements.This is where we step in: we help students find and secure clinical sites around the country via our platform.Why is this so important? There is a primary care shortage in the United States and our NP students often become primary care providers. By helping our customers graduate, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help make US healthcare more accessible.
